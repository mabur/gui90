WINDOWS APPROACH
* Have a discrete depth buffer.
* Keep track of current depth.
* Process widgets from front to back.
* Set active window region before adding widgets.
  - Draw this window to the depth buffer.
* Clip outside of resulting active window region in depth buffer.
* Allow cutting out sub-windows, like scrollable areas.


IMPLEMENTATION
* Implement all widgets functions as generic GUI90_Update(struct) -> struct, that takes the input state and returns the output state.
  - Currently the update functions return a GUI90_Widget, which works ok for simple widgets, but maybe not for more advanced composed widgets like a multiline text input, with scrollbars
